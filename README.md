ROBOT APPLICATION


A company working in artificial intelligence domain is planning to create a Robot. But before they do heavy investment in Robot research and development, they requested their technical team to do a small prototype and create a Robot with some basic features. 

Technical team decided to introduce following features in the Robot prototype:

Power Operated:
1.	Robot works on battery and can walk for 5 km per full battery charge. 
2.	If remaining battery is less than 15%, a red light on Robot head should lit up indicating low battery.

Handling physical objects:

3.	Robot can carry any object not weighing more than 10 Kg.

4.	For every Kilogram carried by Robot, 2% extra battery will be consumed.

5.	If the weight of the object is more than 10 Kg, Robot display [LED display on chest] will show message “Overweight”.


Technical team handed over these details to IT team to build a software for Robot. Please create a Robot application in Java for automating all the features listed above. 

Please provide out of how much battery is remaining in following scenarios:

Robot walks for 3.5 KM	-----------------------------30% battery remains

Robot walks for 2 Km carrying 3 Kg weight----------- 54% battery remains 

Robot carries 12 Kg weight.------------------------- Overweight

Robot carries 9 Kg weight.-------------------------- 82% battery remains

Robot walks for 4.5 KM	---------------------------- 10% battery remains and lit up red light
